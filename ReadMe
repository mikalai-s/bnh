The project requires MongoDB to persist data.

Here is sample instruction of installing MongoDb on a machine:

	1. Download lagest build from http://www.mongodb.org/downloads

	2. Create the following folder structure:

		C:\data
		C:\data\bin  <-- put bin files from zip in here
		C:\data\db  <-- database / data will be saved in here but folder needs to be created
		C:\data\logs  <-- log files will be saved in here but folder needs to be created (This is necessary if you run database as a service)

		(the locations can be changed, these are just the defaults so easiest to use)

	3.a To run database as console application simply start C:\data\bin\mongod.exe

	3.b. To run database as a service:

		- create a text file c:\data\bin\mongod.config with the following content:

			dbpath = c:/data/db
			logpath = c:/data/logs/mongo.log
			logappend = true

		- run the following command to register service:
			
			c:\data\bin\mongod --config "c:\data\bin\mongod.config" -â€“install

		- start service (I recommend to update service to start automatically)

	4. If you want to look inside MongoDB there is a console app that comes with it but a GUI like http://www.mongovue.com/ is easier.
