The project requires MongoDB to persist data.

Here is sample instruction of installing MongoDb on a machine:

	1. Download zip from http://downloads.mongodb.org/win32/mongodb-win32-x86_64-2008plus-2.0.6.zip

	2. Create the following folder structure:

		C:\data
		C:\data\bin  <-- put bin files from zip in here
		C:\data\db  <-- database / data will be saved in here but folder needs to be created

		(the locations can be changed, these are just the defaults so easiest to use)

	3.a To run database as console application simply start C:\data\bin\mongod.exe

	3.b. To run database as a service:

		- create a text file c:\data\bin\mongod.config with the following content:

			dbpath = c:/data/db
			logpath = c:/data/logs/mongo.log
			logappend = true

		- run the following command to register service:
			
			c:\data\bin\mongod --config "c:\data\bin\mongod.config" â€“install

		- start service (I recommend to update service to start automatically)

	4. If you want to look inside MongoDB there is a console app that comes with it but a GUI like http://www.mongovue.com/ is easier.
